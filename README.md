### This is a project created for my participation in the 2021 GIDS Data Science Hackathon.

Essentially, we applied a number of variable and bivarite analysis in attempt to recude the dimension of the data, and from there we created a simple neural network model to predict age with some success.

### Please see the Hackathon_report.pdf and pynotebook for details.
